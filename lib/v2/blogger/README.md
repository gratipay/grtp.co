## Blogger

To add Gratipay to Blogger, use the gadget from gratipay.xml. Go to your
blog overview, then:

    Layout -> Add a Gadget -> Add your own

Enter URL ('https://' prefix didn't work for me):

    grtp.co/v2/blogger/gratipay.xml

Set your "Project slug on Gratipay" and view how it looks on your blog page.
Blogger preview didn't work correctly for me, so don't pay attention to it.
